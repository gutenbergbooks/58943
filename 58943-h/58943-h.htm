<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/titleline.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>:</p>

<p>My theme is the Past and the Present condition, and
the Destiny of the Colored race. The path of thought which
you are invited to travel, has not as I am aware, been
pursued heretofore to any considerable extent. The Present,
is the midway between the Past and the Future.
Let us ascend that sublime eminence, that we may view
the vast empire of ruin that is scarcely discernable through
the mists of former ages; and if, while we are dwelling
upon the desolations that meet our eyes, we shall mourn
over them, I entreat you to look upward and behold the
bright, scenery of the future. There we have a clear sky,
and from thence are refreshing breezes. The airy plains
are radiant with prophetic brightness, and truth, love, and
liberty are descending the heavens, bearing the charter of
man&#8217;s destiny to a waiting world.</p>

<p>All the various forms of truth that are presented to the
minds of men, are in perfect harmony with the government
of God. Many things that appear to be discordant
are not really so; for when they are understood, and the
mind becomes illuminated and informed, the imagined deformities
disappear as spectres depart from the vision of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
one who had been a maniac, when his reason returns.
&#8220;God is the rock, his work is perfect&mdash;a God of truth, and
without iniquity. Justice and judgment are the habitations
of his throne, and mercy and truth go before his face.
His righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and his
law is the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The truth will profit us nothing if we suffer it not to
clothe us in our right minds&mdash;it returns without accomplishing
its high mission to us, if we refuse to let her lead
us to the delectable mountain, from whence we can behold
the pure stream of the law of Jehovah, flowing from
his throne, hailed by angel voices and the music of the
spheres.</p>

<p>In order to pursue my subject I must, for the sake of
distinction, use some of the improper terms of our times.
I shall, therefore, speak of <i>races</i>, when in fact there is but
one race, as there was but one Adam.</p>

<p>By an almost common consent, the modern world seems
determined to pilfer Africa of her glory. It were not
enough that her children have been scattered over the
globe, clothed in the garments of shame&mdash;humiliated and
oppressed&mdash;but her merciless foes weary themselves in
plundering the tombs of our renowned sires, and in obliterating
their worthy deeds, which were inscribed by fame
upon the pages of ancient history.</p>

<p>The three grand divisions of the earth that were known
to the ancients, were colonized by the three sons of Noah.
Shem was the father of the Asiatics&mdash;the Africans descended
from Ham, and Japheth was the progenitor of the Europeans.
These men being the children of one father,
they were originally of the same complexion&mdash;for we cannot
through the medium of any law of nature or reason,
come to the conclusion, that one was black, another was
copper-colored, and the other was white. Adam was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
red man, and by what law of nature his descendants became
dissimilar to him, is a problem which is yet to be
clearly solved. The fact that the universal Father has varied
the complexions of his children, does not detract from
his mercy, or give us reason to question his wisdom.</p>

<p>Moses is the patriarch of sacred history. The same
eminent station is occupied by Herodotus in profane history.
To the chronicles of these two great men we are
indebted for all the information we have in relation to the
early condition of man. If they are incorrect, to what
higher authority shall we appeal&mdash;and if they are true, then
we may acquaint ourselves with the history of our race
from that period,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent1">&#8220;When yonder spheres sublime,</div>
<div class="verse">Peal&#8217;d their first notes to sound the march of time.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Ham was the first African. Egypt was settled by an
immediate descendant of Ham, who, in sacred history, is
called Mesraim, and in uninspired history he is known by
the name of Menes. Yet in the face of this historical evidence,
there are those who affirm that the ancient Egyptians
were not of the pure African stock. The gigantic
stature of the Phynx has the peculiar features of the children
of Ham&mdash;one of the most celebrated queens of Egypt
was Nitocris, an Ethiopian woman; yet these intellectual
resurrectionists dig through a mountain of such evidence,
and declare that these people were not negroes.</p>

<p>We learn from Herodotus, that the ancient Egyptians
were black, and had woolly hair. These people astonished
the world with their arts and sciences, in which they reveled
with unbounded prodigality. They became the
masters of the East, and the lords of the Hebrews. No
arm less powerful than Jehovah&#8217;s, could pluck the children
of Abraham from their hands. The plagues were marshalled
against them, and the pillars of cloud and of fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and at last the resistless sea. &#8220;Then the horse and the
rider, sank like lead in the mighty waters.&#8221; But the kingdom
of Ptolemys was still great. The most exalted mortal
eulogium that could be spoken of Moses, was that he was
learned in all the learning of the Egyptians. It was from
them that he gathered the materials with which he reared
that grand superstructure, partaking of law, poetry, and history,
which has filled the world with wonder and praise.
Mournful reverses of fortune have passed over that illustrious
people. The star that arose in such matchless splendor
above the eastern horizon has had its setting. But
Egypt, Africa&#8217;s dark browed queen, still lives. Her pyramid
tombs&mdash;her sculptured collumns dug from the sands
to adorn modern architecture&mdash;the remnants of her once
impregnable walls&mdash;the remains of her hundred gated
city, rising over the wide-spread ruins, as if to guard the
fame of the race that gave them existence, all proclaim
what she once was.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the extent of prejudice against color,
as it is falsely called, and is so generally practiced in this
country, Solomon, the most renowned of kings, possessed
none of it. Among the seven hundred wives, and the
three hundred concubines, who filled his houses, the most
favored queen was a beautiful sable daughter of one of
the Pharoahs of Egypt. In order to take her to his bosom,
he trampled upon the laws of his nation, and incurred
the divine displeasure&mdash;for a Jew might not espouse
any heathen or idolater who was not circumcised in
heart. When he had secured her, he bowed his great intellect
before her, that he might do her that homage which
he paid to no other woman. Solomon was a poet, and
pure love awakened the sweetest melody in his soul. To
her honor and praise he composed that beautiful poem
called the <span class="smcap">Canticles</span>, or <span class="smcap">Solomon&#8217;s Song</span>. For her he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
wove that gorgeous wreath which is unsurpassed in its
kind, and with his own royal hand placed it upon her dark
brow. Several persons are represented in the poem, and
it is composed of an interesting coloquy. The reader is
introduced to &#8220;the watchmen that went about the streets,&#8221;
and to &#8220;the daughters of Jerusalem,&#8221; and to the bride
and the groom, which are the king and the beauteous
Egyptian. It is not at all surprising that she who received
such distinguished marks of kingly favors, should encounter
the jealousy of the daughters of Jerusalem. They
saw that the Egyptian woman had monopolised the heart
of the son of David, and the royal poet represents his
queen to say to her fairer but supplanted rivals:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent1">&#8220;I am black but comely,</div>
<div class="indent1">O ye daughters of Jerusalem,</div>
<div class="indent1">As the tents of Kedar,</div>
<div class="indent1">As the curtains of Solomon.</div>
<div class="verse">Look not upon me, because I am black,</div>
<div class="verse">Because the sun has looked upon me.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Thus she speaks of the superiority which nature had given
her over the women of Jerusalem. She was handsome,
and like all handsome women, she knew it.</p>

<p>The bride again speaks, and says to the bride-groom:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;I have compared thee, O my love,</div>
<div class="verse">To a company of horses in Pharaoh&#8217;s chariot.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>How inappropriate were this allusion if it had been placed
in the mouth of any one else but an Egyptian. To give
the passage any other interpretation is virtually accusing
Solomon of grosser ignorance than my reverence will allow
me to attribute to him.</p>

<p>Professor <span class="smcap">Stowe</span> and President <span class="smcap">Mahan</span>, and others, agree
in giving the following translation to another verse in the
first chapter of the song,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Ere I was aware</div>
<div class="verse">My soul was as the war-chariot</div>
<div class="verse">Of my noble people.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>The whole poem, without doubt, is nothing more than
a brilliant out-burst of Solomon&#8217;s love for his bride.</p>

<p>Homer, the prince of epic poets, speaks of the Ethiopians,
and presents them at the feast of the gods. These
men of sun-burnt faces, as their name implies, he calls the
excellent Ethiopians.</p>

<p>A distinguished scholar,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> speaking of this passage in the
Grecian&#8217;s renowned poem, in the presence of an American
pedant, the young upstart seriously inquired if the
Ethiopians were black? &#8220;Most assuredly,&#8221; answered
the scholar. &#8220;Well,&#8221; said the young republican, &#8220;had I
been at that feast, and negroes had been placed at the table,
I would have left it.&#8221; &#8220;Had you been living at that time,
returned the other, you would have been saved the trouble
of leaving the table, for the gods would not have invited
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such a man in such a banquet would have been as much
out of place as an ass would be in a concert of sacred
music.</p>

<p>The interior of Ethiopia has not been explored by modern
adventurers. The antiquarian has made his way into
almost every dominion where relics of former greatness
have promised to reward him for his toil. But this country,
as though she had concealed some precious treasure,
meets the traveller on the outskirts of her dominions, with
pestilence and death. Yet, in the Highlands which have
been traversed, many unequivocal traces of former civilization
have been discovered. Very lately, British enterprize
has made some important researches in that region of Country,
all of which go to prove that Homer did not misplace
his regards for them, when he associated them with the
Gods.</p>

<p>The wife of Moses was an Ethiopian woman, and when
Miriam, his sister, murmured against her, the Almighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
smote Miriam, and she became white. Whether the murmuring
arose on account of the complexion of the great
Lawgiver&#8217;s wife, or from some other cause, I will not attempt
to determine. Whatever was the cause, we all see
how Jehovah regarded it, how fierce was his indignation,
and how terrible his punishment. He came down and
stood in a cloudy pillar, and cursed the woman in whose
bosom the unholy prejudice was harbored.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>Ethiopia is one of the few nations whose destiny is spoken
of in prophecy. This is done in language so plain that
we are not driven to dubious inferences.</p>

<p>It is said that &#8220;Princes shall come out of Egypt, and
Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.&#8221; It
is thought by some that this divine declaration was fulfilled
when Philip baptised the converted eunuch of the household
of Candes, the Queen of the Ethiopians. In this
transaction, a part of the prophecy may have been fulfilled,
and only a part.</p>

<p>A vision seen by another prophet has become a matter
of history. Hosea, foresaw that God would call his son out
of Egypt, and when the infant Redeemer could find no
shelter in the land of the Hebrews, he found an asylum in
Egypt, where he remained until Herod was dead. He
then returned to his native country, and in that event he
fulfilled the declaration of the holy seer.</p>

<p>Numerous other instances might be mentioned that would
indicate the ancient fame of our ancestors. A fame, which
arose from every virtue, and talent, that render mortals
pre-eminently great. From the conquests of love and beauty,
from the prowess of their arms, and their architecture,
poetry, mathematics, generosity, and piety. I will barely
allude to the beautiful Cleopatra, who swayed and captivated
the heart of Anthony. To Hannibal, the sworn enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and the scourge of Rome&mdash;the mighty General who
crossed the Alps to meet his foes&mdash;the Alps which had never
before been crossed by an army, nor never since, if we
except Napoleon, the ambitious corsican. To Terence,
Euclid, Cyprian, Origen, and Augustine.</p>

<p>At this time, when these representatives of our race were
filling the world with amazement, the ancestors of the now
proud and boasting Anglo Saxons were among the most
degraded of the human family. They abode in caves under
ground, either naked or covered with the skins of wild
beasts. Night was made hideous by their wild shouts, and
day was darkened by the smoke which arose from bloody
alters, upon which they offered human sacrifice.</p>

<p>For a long series of years, immediately following her
brilliant era, the history of Africa appears not to be animated
by many stiring events. Somewhere about the
year of 1511, Charles V, of Spain, procured slaves from
the coast of Guinea, and sent them to Hispaniola. Bartholemew
Las Cassas, a Roman Catholic priest, and afterwards
bishop Chioppa, came to this new world, which had
just been called out of obscurity by the adventurous spirit
of Christopher Columbus. He left Spain under the auspices
of Charles. The Castillian Monarch had enslaved
the Indians who inhabited his dominions, but soon found
that they were unprofitable in such a relation. Encouraged
by his Clerical confident, his evil genius, he introduced into
South America a number of slaves from Africa, because
one black man could do as much labor as four Indians.
Las Cassas, in mercy to the aborigines, recommended to
Cardinal Zimernes, to enslave the children of Africa.
The Cardinal, to his honor be it said, objected to the project,
but nevertheless the trade went on. The number was
at first limited at four thousand, but as might be expected
this numerical boundry was soon over-steped. A trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that was found to be so lucrative, was ultimately taken up
by almost every Christian nation, until that unhappy country
was annually plundered of 300,000 of her children.
Future generations will gaze upon the names of the guilty
priest and King, in that contemptuous position where they
have placed themselves. Shame will deepen the hatred
of their memory, as men become enlightened and just,
and clouds of infamy will thicken around them as the world
moves on toward God.</p>

<p>In 1620, the very same year in which the Pilgrims landed
on the cold and rocky shores of New England, a Dutch
ship freighted with souls touched the banks of James river,
where the wretched people were employed as slaves in
the cultivation of that hateful weed, tobacco. Wonderful
coincidence! The angel of liberty hovered over New
England, and the Demon of slavery unfurled his black flag
over the fields of the &#8220;sunny south.&#8221;</p>

<p>But latterly the slave-trade has been pronounced to be
piracy by most all of the civilized world. Great Britain
has discarded the chattel principle throughout her dominions.
In 1824 Mexico proclaimed freedom to her slaves.
The Pope of Rome, and the sovereigns of Turkey, and
Denmark, and other nations bow at the shrine of Liberty.
But France has laid the richest offering upon the alter of
freedom, that has been presented to God in these latter
days. In achieving her almost bloodless revolution, she
maintained an admirable degree of consistency. The
same blast of the trumpet of Liberty that rang through the
halls of the Tulleries, and shattered the throne of the
Bourbons, also reached the shores of her remotest colonies,
and proclaimed the redemption of every slave that
moved on French soil. Thus does France remember the
paternal advice of La Fayette, and atone for the murder
of Tousaint. Thanks be to God, the lilly is cleansed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the blood that stained it. The nations of the earth will
gaze with delight upon its democratic purity, wherever it
shall be seen. Whether in the grape-grown valleys where
it first bloomed, or in the Isles of Bourbon, Gaudaloupe,
Martinique, or in Guinna.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> The colored people of St.
Bartholomews, who were emancipated by a decree of the
King of Sweden last year, have lately sent an address to
their Liberator. Hayti, by the heroism of her Oge, Tousaint,
La-Overture, Dessalines, Christophe, Petion, and
Boyer, have driven the demon of slavery from that island,
and have burried his carcase in the sea.</p>

<p>Briefly, and imperfectly have I noticed the former condition
of the colored race. Let us turn for a moment to survey
our present state. The woeful volume of our history as
it now lies open to the world, is written with tears and
bound in blood. As I trace it my eyes ache and my
heart is filled with grief. No other people have suffered
so much, and none have been more innocent. If I might
apostsophize, that bleeding country I would say, O Africa!
thou has bled, freely bled, at every pore! Thy sorrow has
been mocked, and thy grief has not been heeded. Thy
children are scattered over the whole earth, and the great
nations have been enriched by them. The wild beasts of
thy forests are treated with more mercy than they. The
Lybian lion and the fierce tiger are caged to gratify the
curiosity of men, and the keeper&#8217;s hands are not laid
heavily upon them. But thy children are tortured, taunted,
and hurried out of life by unprecedented cruelty.
Brave men formed in the divinest mould, are bartered, sold
and mortgaged. Stripped of every sacred right, they are
scourged if they affirm that they belong to God. Women
sustaining the dear relation of mothers, are yoked with the
horned cattle to till the soil, and their heart strings are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
torn to pieces by cruel seperations from their children.
Our sisters ever manifesting the purest kindness, whether
in the wilderness of their father-land, or amid the sorrows
of the middle passage, or in crowded cities, are unprotected
from the lusts of tyrants. They have a regard for
virtue, and they possess a sense of honor, but there is no
respect paid to these jewels of noble character. Driven
into unwilling concubinage, their offspring are sold by their
Anglo Saxon fathers. To them the marriage institution
is but a name, for their despoilers break down the hymenial
alter and scatter its sacred ashes on the winds.</p>

<p>Our young men are brutalized in intellect, and their
manly energies are chilled by the frosts of slavery. Sometimes
they are called to witness the agonies of the mothers
who bore them writhing under the lash, and as if to fill
up to overflowing the already full cup of demonism, they
are sometimes compelled to apply the lash with their own
hands. Hell itself cannot overmatch a deed like this,&mdash;and
dark damnation shudders as it sinks into its bosom,
and seeks to hide itself from the indignant eye of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Spain, who gave the first impulse and royal sanction to
the slave trade, still clings to her idolatry. It rests as a
plague spot upon the faces of her people. A case lately
ordered before the United States Supreme Court, by one
of her subjects, and favored by President Van Buren, secured
one of the most important decisions ever given in
this Nation. I allude to the case of the Armistad, whose
whole cargo of souls were emancipated on the high seas,
by the heroism of the chieftain Joseph Cinque. He arose
in the strength of his manhood, and slew the captain, and
imprisoned the crew, as they were pursuing their course
from Havanna to Matanzas. Being unacquainted with
navigation, he commanded the seamen to steer towards the
sun-rise, knowing that his native country was in the East.
But the sky becoming cloudy, the traders directed the vessel
towards the American coast, expecting to find favor and
assistance from their fellow bandits and brother pirates in
this country. But in this they were mistaken, for justice
triumphed. When the woe-freighted bark neared our
coast, and Cinque saw the star-spangled banner floating in
the breeze, it was then that the hero addressed his despairing
comrades, while a triumphant smile played upon his
face, and said, &#8220;<i>Brothers, we would have conquered, but
the sun was against us</i>.&#8221; A sentence more heroic was never
uttered by an untutored savage.</p>

<p>It may be asked, why did he despair when he saw the
flag of our country? Here is the answer, and be not surprised
at it. Because he had seen it waving protectively
from the masts of slavers, when freedom owned him as
her child, and when he breathed her spirit on his native
hills.</p>

<p>The slave trade is carried on briskly in the beautiful island
of Cuba. A few years ago, I witnessed the landing
of a cargo of slaves, fresh from the coast of Africa, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
port of Havanna, in the presence of the Governor, and under
the shadow of the Moro Castle, one of the strongest
fortifications of the world.</p>

<p>Recently, a great sacrifice has been made in that Island
to the Spirit of despotism, in the death of the Patriot and
Poet, Placido. Freedom mourns over his early tomb.
The waves of the Atlantic, of whose vastness and sublimity
he had sung, chaunted his dirge as the tyrants hid him
in the grave! Placido was a mulatto, a true Poet, and of
course a Patriot. His noble soul was moved with pity as
he saw his fellow men in chains. Born to feel, and to act,
he made a bold attempt to effect a revolution, and failing
in it, he fell a martyr to his principles.</p>

<p>On the day previous to his death, he wrote the following
lines, of which Coolridge or Montgomery would not have
been ashamed. They present a blaze of poetic fire, intense
and sublime:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="indent1">&#8220;O Liberty! I wait for thee,</div>
<div class="indent1">To break this chain, and dungeon bar;</div>
<div class="indent1">I hear thy voice calling me,</div>
<div class="indent1">Deep in the frozen North, afar,</div>
<div class="verse">With voice like God&#8217;s, and vision like a star.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent1">Long cradled in the mountain wind,</div>
<div class="indent1">Thy mates, the eagle and the storm</div>
<div class="indent1">Arise; and from thy brow unbind</div>
<div class="indent1">The wreath that gives its starry form,</div>
<div class="verse">And smite the strength, that would thy strength deform.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent1">Yet Liberty! thy dawning light,</div>
<div class="indent1">Obscured by dungeon bars, shall cast</div>
<div class="indent1">A splendor on the breaking night,</div>
<div class="indent1">And tyrants flying thick and fast,</div>
<div class="verse">Shall tremble at thy gaze, and stand aghast.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The next day they led Placido forth to execution, and
from the mouths of bristling musketry a shower of lead
was poured upon his quivering heart. That heart stood
still,&mdash;and a truer, braver one, never beat in the breast of
a mortal man!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>The Brazillian Government holds three millions of the
colored race in slavery. The United States have about the
same number. The Spanish Colonies have one million.</p>

<p>But it is proper to turn the other side of the picture,
and I rejoice that there is another side. Nine hundred
thousand of these people are enjoying their freedom in the
British West India Isles. There are six hundred thousand
free people in the United States, while in Hayti we have an
independent population of nearly a million. Possessing a
land of unsurpassed fertility, they have but to turn their
attention manfully to Agricultural pursuits and it will shine
forth the brightest Isle that slumbers in the arms of old
ocean.</p>

<p>In regard to the enslavement of our race, this Country
presents as mournful a picture as any other beneath the
sun; but still it is not hopelessly enshrouded in darkness.
The good institutions of the land are well adapted to the
developement of the mind. So far as the oppressed shall
make their own way towards them, and shall escape the
influence of those that are evil, so far shall they succeed in
throwing off their bitter thraldom, and in wrenching the
scourge from the hands of tyranny.</p>

<p>Slavery has done much to ruin us, and we ourselves have
done some things which effect the same. Perhaps the evils
of which I am about to speak arise from slavery, and are
the things without which the system cannot exist. But
nevertheless we must contribute largely towards their overthrow.
If it is in our power to destroy these evils, and
we do not, then much of our own blood will be found on us.</p>

<p>We are divided by party feuds, and are torn in pieces by
dissensions. Some men have prostituted good talents, for
the base purpose of kindling the fires of discord. Some
who officiated in the temples said to be dedicated to God,
are idolaters to sectarianism. And some too would draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a line of blood distinction, and would form factions upon
the shallow basis of complexion. But I am glad to know
that the number of this class is small, and small as it is, I
pray that we may soon be able to write a cypher in its
place. Let there be no strife between us, for we are brethren,
and we must rise or fall together. How unprofitable
it is for us to spend our golden moments in long and solemn
debate upon the questions whether we shall be called &#8220;<i>Africans</i>,&#8221;
&#8220;<i>Colored Americans</i>,&#8221; or &#8220;<i>Africo Americans</i>,&#8221; or
&#8220;<i>Blacks</i>.&#8221; The question should be, my friends, <i>shall we
arise and act like men, and cast off this terrible yoke?</i>
Many are too apt to follow after shams, and to neglect that
which is solid. Thousands are often expended for an
hour&#8217;s display of utter emptiness, which ought to be laid
aside to increase our wealth, and for the acquirement of
knowledge, and for the promotion of education. Societies,
called benevolent, frequently squander more money
for the purchase of banners and badges, and in feasting,
than they use in acts of charity. What are regalia and other
trappings worth, if they signify nothing but sham and
parade? In 1846, $5000 were paid by the oppressed Colored
people at the Temperance Celebration held in Poughkeepsie,
N. Y., and yet we do not adequately support a
single Newspaper in the United States.</p>

<p>The first of August meeting, held in Canandaigua, in
1847, cost the same class not less than $10,000; and yet
we do not find <i>a hundred</i> of our young men and women in
our high-schools and colleges. The gorgeous pageant of
the Odd Fellows in October 1847, drew from the pockets
of the people, at a very moderate calculation, the sum of
$8000, while many of their offspring who ought to be
drinking at the fountain of learning, are mourning by the
turbid and cold waters of servile employments. The <span class="smcap">Free
and accepted Masons</span> can boast nothing over other fraternities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in regard to unnecessary expenditures. The Masons
have led off in this course of wastefulness, and a majority of
the other institutions are but children of the great <small>ORIGINAL</small>,
and they resemble their parent more or less. Let no one
say that I seek the destruction of these Institutions. I desire
rather to remove the unfruitful branches of the trees,
that it may be ascertained whether their trunks are capable
of bearing good fruit. If they can produce good, if there
is life in the stock, let them remain that they may be beautified
by the dresser&#8217;s hands. But if the roots are corrupt,
and their branches cast a deadly shade, let them be cut
down, for why should they cumber the ground?</p>

<p>May God grant, that we may betake ourselves to greater
wisdom and frugality. I know that the oppressed above
all other people need holidays, and pastimes, but in no
case should we bid adieu to our common sense. Let all
be careful, lest in this age of ribbon, velvet and gold lace
revival, that we do not fall into fanaticism. Fanatics sometimes
have strange visions, and it would be strange, &#8220;passing
strange,&#8221; should any considerable portion of a whole
race imagine themselves in a world of ribbons, painted
sticks, and vanity without measure.</p>

<p>We ought to have our monster meetings, but we should
assemble with the same spirit, that animated the Irish people,
when they were led by that giant of freedom Daniel
O&#8217;Connell, which should be, to use his own words,
to &#8220;agitate, and agitate, and agitate until the chains
of the three millions are broken.&#8221; A half penny&#8217;s
worth of green ribbon and a sprig of shamrock signified
to the Irishman more than all the gaudy trappings of
a Grand Master, or a Prince of Jerusalem. These little
things represented a grand principle to the minds of the
unconquerable sons of Erin. <i>The principles of progress in
the ways of truth, and resistence to tyranny should be the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
<i>bases of all our public demonstrations, and numerical representations.</i></p>

<p>We should have likewise, days of bitter bread, and tabernacle
in the wilderness, in which to remember our grief-worn
brothers and sisters. They are now pleading with
million tongues against those who have dispoiled them.
They cry from gory fields&mdash;from pestilential rice swamps&mdash;from
cane breaks, and forests&mdash;from plantations of cotton
and tabacco&mdash;from the dark holds of slave ships, and from
countless acres where the sugar cane nods to the sighing
winds. They lift up their voices from all the land over
which the flag of our country floats. From the banks of
our silver streams, and broad rivers, from our valleys and
sloping hills, and mountain tops!</p>

<p>The silence that reigns in the region where the pale nations
of the earth slumber, is solemn, and awful. But
what think ye, when you are told that every rood of land
in this Union is the grave of a murdered man, and their
epitaphs are written upon the monuments of the nation&#8217;s
wealth. Ye destroyers of my people draw near, and read
the mournful inscription; aye! read it, until it is daguerotyped
on your souls. &#8220;You have slain us all the day
long&mdash;you have had no mercy.&#8221; Legions of haggard
ghosts stalk through the land. Behold! see, they come:
Oh what myriads! Hark hear their broken bones as they
clatter together! With deep unearthly voices they cry
&#8220;We come, we come! for vengeance we come! Tremble,
guilty nation, for the God of Justice lives and reigns.&#8221;
The screaming of the eagle as he darts through lightning
and storm is unheard because of these voices. The tocsin
of the sabbath, and the solemn organ are mocked by
them. They drown the preacher&#8217;s voice, and produce
discord in the sacred choirs. Sworn senators and perjured
demagogues, as they officiate around the alter of Moloch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
in the national capitol, they hear the wailings of the
victims of base born democracy, and they are ill at ease
in their unexampled hypocracy. The father of waters,
may roar in his progress to the ocean&mdash;the Niagara may
thunder, but these voices from the living and the dead, rise
above them all.</p>

<p>Such, ladies and gentlemen, are the outlines of the picture
of the Colored Race throughout the world. Behind
us and on either side are waste places, and deserts, but
before us are green spots and living springs.</p>

<p>The genius of slavery in this country has taken his course
southward. It has passed its Rubicon, the far distant Sabine.
Infatuated with its victories, it has pressed forward
to the sandy shores of the Neuces, where it paused but
for a moment. It has Texas and moves on beyond the
Rio Del Norte.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Six slave states added at a breath! one flourish of a pen,</div>
<div class="verse">And fetters are riveted on millions more of men,</div>
<div class="verse">How all the damned leap up, and half forget their fire,</div>
<div class="verse">To think men take such pains to claim the notice of God&#8217;s ire.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Nor has it been satisfied when all this was done. It has
laid its hands upon the nation&#8217;s standard, and has urged its
way through flood, and field, until that blood-stained banner
waves on the halls of the Montazumas. It claims its
victories on the ensanguined plains of Monterey, Cero Gordo,
Chepultepec, Churubusco, and Beuna Vista, and hangs
out its stiffened and gory garments from the old grey
walls of Vera Cruz. These are but a part of slavery&#8217;s
conquests on this continent. It is among the things that
are possible that these triumphs are defeats in disguise.
&#8220;God taketh the wise in their own craftiness, and the counsel
of the ungodly carries headlong.&#8221; I would not
dispair of the triumph of freedom in the hemisphere, were
Mexico to be annexed to this union. For one I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
welcome my dark-browed and liberty-loving brethren to
our embrace. Aye! let them come with the population of
seven and a half millions. One fifth of that number are
white, and they are ultra Abolitionists. Two fifths are Indians,
and the other two fifths are of the black, and mixed
races. I repeat it, I should not dispair if they should come.</p>

<p>The dominions of slavery are directly between Northern
and Southern freedom&mdash;between Eastern and Western
Democracy. In the East the sons of New England are
waking up at freedom&#8217;s call, among the tombs of their fathers.</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Grey Plymouth&#8217;s Rock hath yet a tongue, and Concord is not dumb.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men of the North begin to appreciate the doctrine
which has been long inculcated, that in order to be free
themselves, they must emancipate the bondmen. The young
lion of the West has torn the net of voluntary servitude,
and gives signs of his latent strength. &#8220;The peculiar Institution&#8221;
is doomed. President Polk sees this, and he
spares neither blood, nor treasure to save it. Mr. John C.
Calhoun is aware of it, and like some mighty Collossus,
he stands astride the dark and troubled waters of his darling
system, and like a frightened girl, appeals piteously to
his brethren of the North and the South, to come to the
rescue, and save him from a humiliating downfall. His
predicament is pictured, very correctly by the gifted and
devoted Bard of Liberty, <span class="smcap">John Greenleaf Whittier</span>.</p>

<p>New and startling scenes are passing before us continually.
No man of common sense, will declare to-day, that he
will not be on the side of freedom to-morrow. All the
while the Colored race, are increasing in a ratio unprecedented
in the history of any oppressed people.</p>

<p>The Spaniard conquered Mexico three hundred years
ago. His impress is scarcely preceptible upon it. Many
of the chiefs of the country are mixed blood, some of them
pure Indian, while the population, as a whole, is altogether
mongrel.</p>

<p>But there is another race (the negro) &#8220;parallel, co-relative,
and inter-mixed with the Anglo-American. Include
Texas, and go from the East boundary of the Louisiana
purchase, to the Rio Grande, thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>Who is there, after looking at these facts, will question
the probability of the assumption, that this republic, and
this continent, are to be the theatre in which the grand drama
of our triumphant Destiny is to be enacted.</p>

<p>The Red men of North America are retreating from the
approach of the white man. They have fallen like trees
on the ground in which they first took root, and on the soil
which their foliage once shaded. But the Colored race,
although they have been transplanted in a foreign land,
have clung to and grown with their oppressors, as the wild
ivy entwines around the trees of the forest, nor can they
be torn thence. At this moment when so much feigned
hatred is manifested toward us, our blood is mixed with
every tribe from Cape Horn to the Frozen Ocean. Skillful
men have set themselves to work at analyzation, and yet
in many cases they are perplexed in deciding where to
draw the line between the Negro and the Anglo-Saxon.
Whatever our colorless brethren say of themselves, so far
do they proclaim our future position. Do they say in
proud exultation,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;No pent up Utica contracts our powers,</div>
<div class="verse">The whole boundless continent is ours,&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>in this they bespeak our destiny.</p>

<p>There are those who, either from good or evil motives,
plead for the utopian plan of the Colonization of a whole
race to the shores of Africa. We are now colonized.
We are planted here, and we cannot as a whole people,
be re-colonized back to our father-land. It is too late to
make a successful attempt to separate the black and white
people in the New World. They love one another too
much to endure a separation. Where one is, there will the
other be also. Ruth, of the Old Testament, puts the resolve
of our destiny in our mouths, which we will repeat
to those who would expatriate us: &#8220;Entreat me not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
leave thee nor return from following after thee, for whither
thou goest I will go, and where thou lodgest I will lodge;
thy people shall be my people, and thy God shall be my
God. Where thou diest there will I die, and there will I
be buried. The Lord do so to me, and more, if aught
but death part thee and me.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>This western world is destined to be filled with a mixed
race.</i> Statesmen, distinguished for their forecast, have
gravely said that the blacks must either be removed, or
such as I have stated will be the result. It is a stubborn
fact, that it is impossible to separate the pale man and the
man of color, and therefore the result which to them is so
fearful, is inevitable. All this the wiser portion of the
Colonizationists see, and they labor to hinder it. It matters
not whether we abhor or desire such a consummation,
it is now too late to change the decree of nature and circumstances.
As well might we attempt to shake the Alleghanies
with our hands, or to burst the rock of Gibralter
with our fists. If the colored people should all consent to
leave this country, on the day of their departure there
would be sore lamentations, the like of which the world
has not heard since Rachel wept for her children, and
would not be comforted, because they were not. We
would insist upon taking all who have our generous and
prolific blood in their veins. In such an event, the American
church and state would be bereaved. The Reverend
Francis L. Hawks, D. D., of the Protestant Episcopal
Church, a man who is receiving the largest salary of any
divine in the country, would be called upon to make the
sacrifice of leaving a good living, and to share the fate of
his brethren according to the flesh. The Reverend Dr.
Murphy, of Herkimer, N. Y., a Presbyterian, would be
compelled to leave his beloved flock; and how could they
endure the loss of a shepherd so eloquent, so faithful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
so kind. We should be burdened with that <i>renegade negro</i>
of the United States Senate, Mr. <span class="smcap">Yulee</span>, of Florida.
We should take <i>one</i> of the wives of Senator Samuel Houston.
The consort,&mdash;the beautiful Cleopatra of his Excellency,
R. M. Johnson, late Democratic Vice President of
this great nation,&mdash;would be the foremost in the vast company
of exiles. After we all should return to tread the golden
sands of <span class="smcap">Africa</span>, whether we would add to the morality of
our kindred across the deep waters future generations
would decide. One thing I am certain of, and that is, many
of the slaveholders and lynchers of the South are not very
moral now. Our cousins of the tribe of Shem are welcome
to our deserters. If they are enriched by them
they may be assured that we are not impoverished.</p>

<p>On the other continent, the destiny of the colored people
will be similar to that of the people among whom they
are scattered. Colorphobia is confined almost entirely to
the United States and the Canadas. We speak of prejudice
against color, but in fact, nothing of the kind exists.
The prejudice is against the condition alone. Were not
this the case the American feeling would pervade the
whole earth.</p>

<p>Many things that were intended for evil to us, will result,
I trust, in good. The tyrants have debarred us from
the wealth accruing from trade and commerce. This is an
evil. But may it not be hoped that we are their juniors in
the art of cheating? We have among us some arrant
cheats, but it is presumed that but a few will doubt that
our white brothers bear off the palm in this department of
human depravity. The besetting sins of the Anglo-Saxon
race are, the love of gain and the love of power. In many
instances, while our services could be dispensed with,
we have not been permitted to join the army, and of course
have not been killed in the wars. We have been driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
from the sanctuaries where our oppressors worship, and it
may be that we are not quite as hypocritical as their practices
have made them. When the great national account
shall be rendered before the tribunal of Justice, the guilt
of course must be borne by those who might have had, or
who have used the power of the government. There may,
therefore, be some good that may come out of this evil.
But no thanks to the evil doers. Their works are evil still,
the good comes in spite of them.</p>

<p>The old doctrine of the natural inferiority of the colored
race, propagated in America by Mr. Thomas Jefferson,
has long since been refuted by Dr. John Mason Goode,
and numerous respectable witnesses from among the slandered,
both living and dead: Pushkin in Russia, Dumas
in France, Toussaint in Hayti, Banaker, Theodore Sedgwick
Wright, and a host in America, and a brilliant galaxy
in Ancient History.</p>

<p>There are blessings in store for our patient, suffering
race,&mdash;there is light and glory. The star of our hope is
slowly and steadily rising above the horizon. As a land
that has long been covered by storm and clouds, and shaken
by the thunder, when the storms and clouds had passed
away, and the thunder was succeeded by a calm, like that
which cheered the first glad morning, and flower and shrub
smiled as they looked up to God, and the mountains, plains
and valleys rung with joy,&mdash;so shall this race come forth
and re-occupy their station of renown.</p>

<p>But how shall we hasten on that period? How shall
we acquit ourselves on the field where the great battle is
to be fought? By following after peace and temperance,
industry and frugality, and love to God, and to all men,
and by resisting tyranny in the name of Eternal Justice.
We must also become acquainted with the arts and sciences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and agricultural pursuits. These will elevate any people
and sever any chain.</p>

<p>We must also cherish and maintain a national and patriotic
sentiment and attachment. Some people of color say
that they have no home, no country. I am not among
that number. It is empty declamation. It is unwise. It
is not logical&mdash;it is false. Of all the people in this wide
earth, among the countless hordes of misery, there is not
one so poor as to be without a home and a country. America
is my home, my country, and I have no other. I love
whatever of good there may be in her institutions. I hate
her sins. I loathe her slavery, and I pray Heaven that ere
long she may wash away her guilt in tears of repentance.
I love the green-hills which my eyes first beheld in my infancy.
I love every inch of soil which my feet pressed in
my youth, and I mourn because the accursed shade of
slavery rests upon it. I love my country&#8217;s flag, and I hope
that soon it will be cleansed of its stains, and be hailed by
all nations as the emblem of freedom and independence.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
